51,yqR4PtpO8X,"I have almost everything Scythe related. I fell in love with this game shortly after it was commercially released and my love for it has not waned years later. It's a perfect mesh of complexity with iconography that once understood (which is easy to do) feels simple! The different factions work your brain in every which way - and you over time you will realize that there is a group of people that believes every single faction is overpowered....which to me means that they are pretty balanced (well...as balanced as asymmetric factions CAN be).

Scythe will always be a collection essential for me."
56,yqR4PtpO8X,"Scythe was a game I was unsure if I'd be interested in. I'd heard amazing things about it, and thought it seemed interesting enough. Luckily it was purchased for me as a gift, and since then this game has been a huge hit. I was afraid the game wouldn't hit the table much at all but it continuously receives play anywhere from 2 to 3/4 players fairly frequently and a few 5+ player games. Everyone loves the game and we've reached an efficiency level so that 2-3 player games only last 40-45 minutes. While there are plenty of folks who have a number of qualms with the game, most of which I've heard and totally understand, this whole experience just clicks right for me and my group and we absolutely adore it.

Don't be fooled, this isn't a war game with a lot of strategy and combat between mechs. This is a euro game; worker placement, area controller, and resource management all the way. Overall it's an engine optimization puzzle, with other players as potential obstacles or threats to you reaching your max efficiency."
121,8UmzC1ZGGE,"This is a hit with the kids, thus it's a hit with me. I like the fact that it's a light and fun ""wargame"" with some fantasy/comedic elements. All in all, a great way to spend an hour with people you care about. :)"
90,yqR4PtpO8X,"lived up to my expectations. Easy to teach, can be quick, just an amazing all around game from one of the best publishers out there.

Edit 1/16/18: Bumped from 9.4 to 9.7 I was initially skeptical of all the hype surrounding this game, but it has honestly exceeded the hype for me after 22 plays. Attacking with the mechs may be more sparse than initially expected, but the tension created by the threat of attack is just as effective for area control and board manipulation. Wind gambit adds significantly to this tension. Love love love this game."
165,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Takes the men on maps mechanic and makes it very fun and more tactical than something like Risk, but still light and fast moving. I love all the races and the way that powers each one has will change every game."
30,yqR4PtpO8X,"I mainly play this solo, and it's a really challenging system.  Really good game mechanics, engine building is so fun, the art is amazing, just an overall really good game.  I imagine the expansions would really shine with a regular gaming group, but find that they don't really work well for solo players."
55,yqR4PtpO8X,Had a blast each time playing this. Plenty of paths to victory and the different combinations of boards give this a lot of replayability.  The only negative in my mind is the encounter cards all feel the same.
31,yqR4PtpO8X,1-5
63,yqR4PtpO8X,"But not this one. I've played twice. It's my least desired of all the ones I've played. My buddy backed the KS and made sure to get everything deluxed. Beautiful components, but like many of Jamey's designs, it appears he's taken his favorite bits of previous games and stuck them in whatever current one he's designed. I think it worked for Viticulture and Euphoria. I just couldn't get into this one. I'm still figuring out all the hype that was generated on the box cover art alone..."
109,8UmzC1ZGGE,Art and theme is awesome.  Easy game to learn and plays fairly quickly.  The race/trait combos expands the replay value for a long time.Only downside is the box insert.  No clear way to pack everything nice and neat back into the box.  The armies tray does not hold everything evenly and the instruction book diagram for the insert in the back is garbage.
37,yqR4PtpO8X,Basically everything I want in a short strategy game.
106,8UmzC1ZGGE,"2-6 players, 60 minutes, light medium, area control/war gameHave played with 2, 3 and 4 players and all work quite well. The game has different boards for the various number of players, so it will always be a world too small for everyone, which ensures there's plenty of action  The game looks great and the numerous combinations of races and special powers (which are different every game) ensure that replayability is high."
161,8UmzC1ZGGE,"First of all, Tales & Legends is an absolute must. Don't play or buy without it. The gameplay is too straight forward, as most of the strategy comes from selecting races and selecting when to go into 'Decline', while the rest of the game kind of plays itself out as you observe from the sideline. The two player game is very weak(unless played with 2 races each), and with five players downtime dominates. Better suited for the youngsters (or as the app)."
100,yqR4PtpO8X,y
23,yqR4PtpO8X,"This is a solid area control / euro game, disguised as a war game. While the art and miniatures are top notch, I found the gameplay to be a bit... slow and plodding? I would definitely play it again, but I don't think that I would buy it for my collection."
21,yqR4PtpO8X,Great game for any size group 2-5 and solid and challenging solo experience once you can learn the movement rules for the Automa
163,8UmzC1ZGGE,"My first venture into the hobby and boy, am I glad I did. A close friend didn't like the simple, repetitive dice rolling of Risk and wanted something new. Picked this up on an Amazon sale and haven't looked back. It's fantasy theme was an instant hit and it's replay value is super high."
44,yqR4PtpO8X,"First let's get this out of the way. Scythe is basically an overproduced euro...

And I LOVE IT!! 

This game is all about efficiency and posturing. With the threat of war. It has a very ominous vibe throughout the whole game. 

I think people see mechs and think that this is all about dudes on a map and combat. If you go in with that attitude you will be very disappointed. This game is about building an engine and managing resources. You need to try your best to figure out which 6 stars you will be going for and then go. It might very well be that combat and area control will be a path to your victory or it might be setting up an engine of pumping out tons of resources and avoiding all combat as much as possible.

As far as calling a game a 4x or not. I hate how people can get so riled up over terms. I don't care if it fits into that ""box"" or not. I think the game does an excellent job of giving you the feeling of a 4x game all within a shorter time. (a hour and a half) For me that's why I often prefer to play Scythe over those other games. 

It won't be very often that I could get a group together to play some epic 6+ hour epic game. So I play Scythe instead."

I play it a bit more tactically than strategically after less than 10 plays, but expect to ""graduate"" soon as I learn the different capabilities of the factions and player boards.  Looks more daunting than it is.  Rules fairly simple to remember and implement.  Your choices are a delicate balance. To me, it lives up to the hype."

34,yqR4PtpO8X,"Theme and artwork is amazing!  The game is simple to learn and easy to teach others.  It starts slow but ramps up quickly and turns do not take long after the initial rounds.  Only downside is that the game ends rather abruptly.  Right around the time you start making big moves and upgrades, the game ends suddenly."
26,yqR4PtpO8X,"Great looking components and well thought out gameplay, but it's not as exciting as other games."
149,8UmzC1ZGGE,"My initial impressions of this game were very strong, but over time the races just don't feel distinct enough.  Good idea, and a great game for non-gamers, but I don't see myself playing it a lot more."
157,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Very easy to learn, and a varied and thematic set of races and abilities.  Also provides multiple boards for easy scaling to number of players. 

I'm not sure there's really much here in the way of gameplay, either tactically or strategically: while moving your armies, there seems to be either a blindingly obvious best move, or several identical moves; the only decision you actually make in this game is which opponent to mess with.

This means three things.  First, since there are no real decisions to make, combat is dull.  Second, there is a big gang-up-on-whoever-is-winning factor, since there's no real way to deter attacks against your opponents aside from creating a wall of guys at your frontiers, Risk-style (and, again Risk-style, an opponent can break through and gobble up your delicious unprotected interior).  Third, since there is also a significant difference in the power levels of the various races and race qualities, there's a big luck factor involved, with the player who happens to be ready to decline when Ghouls or Sorcerers are in the mix in much better shape than the guy who is seeing Dwarves and Wizards (who are boring as well as awful!)

I will give this game high marks for style, but style can't completely make up for dull gameplay."

89,yqR4PtpO8X,"Another game I really don't like, but this is one of the first that had me not liking it from turn 1. I kinda stuck through it for the whole game but I regret that, the worst part is I felt like I was losing from the point I realized the faction placement and mine was against what I planned to do. I guess it's like blood rage that completely polarizes me even though it's not a horrible game."

It's weird how all the boards are different and get mixed/matched with each game, so it makes it sort of puzzly in what you get and what you can do each game.  Not sure if it makes a huge difference in the end or not.  I wasn't blown away, but the game was pleasant enough though it was slightly long, maybe that speeds up with more play.

(-) Randomly dealt player mats can result in some factions being overpowered IMO (ex. Rusviet with Industrial board), new players can get overwhelmed with all the different things to keep track of

(+/-) The game is fun at all player counts but it feels really different from a spacial standpoint. Some people will not like the act of combat being primarily about bluffing/mind games. There is a lot to keep track of, but action choices are simplified and it provides a lot of paths to victory."
159,8UmzC1ZGGE,Only one mechanic? And a boring one when left alone at that. This should be the kids version of a much better game.

22,yqR4PtpO8X,Love this game. Solid 10. It's not a 4X despite the looks. Solid solid worker placement with area control. Tons of different set-ups. Satisfying art. Nice minis (that smell of play-doh!) Once you know what you're doing play is fast fast fast! We can get a 3 or 4 player game done in 60-90 minutes. So satisfying.
41,yqR4PtpO8X,"Collector's Edition. Awesome game! I played it four times in the first week I owned it which I have never done with a big game before. Even my wife loves it and she doesn't really care for complex games with a lot of rules. This one hits the sweet spot between accessibility and complexity. I certainly wouldn't call it a gateway game but I could definitely see teaching it to and playing it with anyone that could handle games like Catan, Small World and Lords of Waterdeep.

This is my favorite game of 2016 and the best game/value that I have Kickstarted. It's early to call, but this game is almost certainly destined for my top five. This is the example that game publishers should be striving for in terms of components, rulebook, iconography, art, ease of access, replayability, accessibility and value.

Our first three-player game took three hours but our next two with the same players took only an hour and a half each (we played them back-to-back, it's that good). Turns are near simultaneous with three players, so there is very little downtime.

The game is very intuitive and after the first few turns, you know what to do and how most things work. From that point on, it's a matter of learning how to optimize your actions and developing an overall strategy.

There are five asymmetrical factions, each with their own special abilities. There are also five different player mats that have the same abilities but with slightly different costs and benefits. Each game you play, you get a different combination of these. Then you add in different secret objectives, different factory abilities and different end game bonuses for buildings and you get a heck of a lot of replayability.

If I had a complaint (and I don't) it would be that there isn't a whole lot of player interaction during the game. The board is big enough that you can pretty much do your own thing in your own corner of the map without much interference. I am sure in four or five player games there is a lot more interaction as players jostle for resources and space.

Super game! If you like worker placement and area control, you should love this one!

66,yqR4PtpO8X,"After one play: I really really don't understand what people see in this game.

After giving this game a second chance:  When looking at what the rating system says here, I had no choice but to drop my rating of this game down to a 2.  Because for 2 it says ""Extremely annoying game, won't play this ever again.""  The nicest thing I can say about this game is that the metal coins are really cool.  The artwork, close up, is good, but the overall presentation looks like a giant Technicolor yawn.  I suppose if I got sucked into the hype and spent a fortune on this turd I'd probably be trying to convince myself and others that this game is awesome, too.  But I didn't, so I am telling you that this game definitely is not for me as it annoys me and I won't play it anymore."

69,yqR4PtpO8X,#9
97,yqR4PtpO8X,"From a design perspective there is not much to critisize. The different clans seem balanced, and provide each player with a unique strategy, and the same can be said for the action boards.  However, from a gameplay perspective some of aspects fall a bit short. For instance, the early game is incredibly limiting, and players fall into scripted openings. And though I enjoy the star-based end game trigger, it appears that a few are more or less mandatory. Completing secret objectives, and winning a battle, are much easier to accomplish than maxing out the power or popularity tracks. All together, the decision space appears to be bigger than it really is. The biggest win here, surprisingly to me, is the world building. The premise and setting alone will likely lure me into several more plays."

98,yqR4PtpO8X,"Theme/Art:
Scythe is the most beautiful game I own. Jakub Rozalski is an amazing artist and the art is 11/10, if not more.  Same goes for the theme as the game sets place in an alternative history in the 1920s where countries build giant battle mechs.

Production quality:
Amazing production quality, the board has 2 sides with one having a bigger map so you have more space for resources (you need to purchase a board extension to use it), the miniatures are very good, and every faction has different worker meeples, which is a nice touch. Nothing feels cheap in Scythe.

Replayability:
There are 5 factions with different abilities and different starting resources and also 5 player mats with different top and bottom rows, as well as different action costs. So you have to take a different approach each game, even if you play the same faction twice.

Depth/Difficulty:
The game takes a bit to explain, but it is actually not that hard and once you get the hang of it it has a nice flow. Since everybody only takes one top row action and maybe a bottom one on his turn, you don't have to wait long until you are up again.
The game has very interesting mechanics, especially how the game ends. Once someone placed all their 6 stars it's over. So if you are ahead and only have one star to place you can end the game immediately, but if you are behind in money you can drag the game out by not placing your last star (unless someone else places all their stars of course).
The fact that you don't get resources you produced into your supply, but they are placed on the hex they are produced on, is also very interesting, because you can steal resources from others if they don't watch out.
I also like that the encounter cards have no text on them (aside from your options), but only a picture of the scene, so you have to interpret it in your own way.
I weight it 3/5.

Strategy:
Scythe is a strategy game, so of course their is a lot of strategy involved. Your strategy should depend on your faction, player mat, and starting position. There are 10 ways to plays stars, but you only need to place 6 to end the game, so focus on 6 of those ways. E.g. if you draw shitty objectives, ignore them.
Oh, and get your popularity up to at least 13, you need it for the scoring!

Luck:
Aside from your starting setup (faction and player mat) and the cards you draw (encounters, objectives, factory cards) there is no luck involved. Even combat is not luck, but using power and power cards (and knowing how much power your enemy will spend.

Scythe takes about 80-150 minutes to play, depending on player count and how familiar players are with the game. Teaching the rules takes about 20 minutes.

In summary I like Scythe very much and it is the best looking game I own at the moment. We will see if its rating stays that high after a few more plays."
82,yqR4PtpO8X,Awesome. Has lots of replayability
35,yqR4PtpO8X,"Scythe is great for veteran board game players, but can be too much for more inexperienced players. The game is well designed, but oftentimes is too long. At least one player will realize they have no chance of winning, and will then complain the rest of the game. 

Also, get boxes for all the meeples."
118,8UmzC1ZGGE,"It's a decent-ish game, but I'm not really a fan."
130,8UmzC1ZGGE,"I love this game for 2 players. However, my one 4-player experience had way too much down time.

Update: Lowering my score because it just works so much better as an app. It has made me realize that, as a board game, it's a little slow and clunky."
158,8UmzC1ZGGE,The theme turns me off and I prefer Vinci.
47,yqR4PtpO8X,This game just doesn't click with me. It's a decent game. It has some unique mechanics. It's interesting enough that I'd play it more but it mostly just feels... unsatisfying.
126,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Simple rules but a lot of replayability, especially with the expansions."
96,yqR4PtpO8X,"Scythe is a very rare combination of strong, unique theme with strong, unique mechanisms. Every game is an engaging, unique puzzle.

It can best be summed up as an incredibly satisfying experience- the excellent components, world building, game pace and brain-burning decisions have never left me feeling disappointed with a game."
33,yqR4PtpO8X,"July 2016. My first real Kickstarter! I was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype, but I'm happy to report that it met and exceeded my expectations. This is one of my favorite games right now. I look forward to playing it many more times over the years. July 2016Returned rating to a 10. I've played 6 solo games, which is pushing it back up for me. I don't usually care about solo gaming that much, but with my limited time lately, it's nice to be able to knock out a game in the evening in about 90 minutes including setup and breakdown. August, 2016.I'm still in love with this game. I haven't been able to play for over a month, but still have TWENTY NINE plays so far this year (that's just from late July through late October!). Solo mode has been great. I've also been solo-testing a campaign I've designed, playing 4-player games by myself. I've gotten a ton of use out of this, and I truly regret not going all-in on the Kickstarter. I've ordered the metal coins, and maybe someday I'll get the realistic resources. I love this game so much. December 4, 2016"
42,yqR4PtpO8X,"Early rating is tentative but very promising. It is indeed much less about combat than economy management, which is as the game describes. Whether this serves to mitigate or mask the problems often inherent in multi-player conflict games is yet to be seen."
27,yqR4PtpO8X,"I love that this is a very well thought out strategy game and yet it's easy to learn the rules. I also like the fact that it isn't focused on combat, although you will need to combat other players every now and then. Excellent game, highly recommend it. Even more fun with 5 players."
83,yqR4PtpO8X,There is so much to this game. It's compelling to both play and to look at. So many ways to play and subtle changes based on your faction and player board that even a veteran player has to stay on their toes.
107,8UmzC1ZGGE,i realy wanted to like this game.. but i hate the downtime between turns.. it realy spoils it for me.  some games have a bearable downtime as they are quite heavy and that's part of the deal.. but this is too light for the down time it has.
120,8UmzC1ZGGE,"My wife likes it which means, I like it."
75,yqR4PtpO8X,"I haven't gotten to play with more than 2, but solo and 2 player is fantastic and it's supposed to be even better with 4/5"
138,8UmzC1ZGGE,"If you're not a fan of area control war themed games, chances are your exposure is mostly Risk or Axis and Allies. Smallworld takes the region conquering motif to a more strategic level. There are no dice - well, ok there is one die to act as support if you don't have enough tokens left over for your last invasion. Otherwise it's simply invade and defend. Each race gets paired randomly with a power. And since the combinations change with every game, the possibilities are endless. When your race expands too thin, just go into decline and start a new one. The game plays fast and competitive. It's even more fun if you play on a board meant for one player fewer (ie, play 5 people on the 4 player board, etc.)."
95,yqR4PtpO8X,"""Baby steps the board game"" with the occasional satisfying turn. Very pretty game."

152,8UmzC1ZGGE,"This game is an average, solid game. Two major complaints:

1) Once you choose your race, the remaining choices are pretty obvious. Not much strategy or creativity here, which makes it less exciting.

2) The artwork on the board is EXTREMELY busy. This makes it very difficult to see your pieces, especially when multiple players' pieces are upside down (which makes them all grey in color). It's a problem."

73,yqR4PtpO8X,"I really can't say anything more than this is definitely in my top 3 all time games. Pandemic Legacy, Cosmic Encounter, and now Scythe to round it out"
45,yqR4PtpO8X,Collector's Edition
24,yqR4PtpO8X,"Decent game, but maybe too much emphasis on the production value (which is admittedly pretty good)."
54,yqR4PtpO8X,"This game feels like Copycat, in that it shamelessly steals mechanics from other good games in an attempt to make one cohesive game, but without the satire. The end result is typical of the designer; a reasonably good game with nothing remarkable or groundbreaking about it except for the amount of chrome applied."
135,8UmzC1ZGGE,"I don't care for it. The race market is too imbalanced, and I don't care for the general flow of the game. Good strategy dictates declining as soon as possible, which minimizes the interaction of the area control. 

Bleh"
64,yqR4PtpO8X,"A resource management game with huge variability, individual player powers, various avenues to victory, hard choices that don't take a long time, reasonable play time, amazing artwork and a little optional conflict thrown into the mix. A 10, especially after the addition of The Rise of Fenris

INCLUDED:
Scythe: Invaders from Afar 
Scythe: The Rise of Fenris
Scythe: Metal Coins
Scythe: Encounters"

Notes i keep forgetting!
-A structure can be built- on the factory
-Anyone can carry resources, only mechs can carry workers
-When taking the bottom row action, if you have already enlisted , the player to your left and right and you get a benefit

4 games in, rating a 7.5 for now.
5th game in have changed rating to an 8. This was another four player game and loved it!"
85,yqR4PtpO8X,So clever and beautiful. 
113,8UmzC1ZGGE,I bought it simply because it was recommended as a must have. Do not understand why :(
160,8UmzC1ZGGE,"The funness of this game is largely based on who you play with, as the best part is convincing other players to attack your enemies instead of you. Plays best with 4 or 5, not recommended for 2."
110,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Good looking, fast. ""Wargame"" that my wife plays (yeah I know its not really a wargame). My kid somehow can play this one really good, winning a lot without me holding any punches. (6-year old)As long as someone doesn't start to think too much about the game and just plays fast and to the spirit of it, its fun and quick game."
84,yqR4PtpO8X,Fun game and captivating world. Only a nine because of how long it takes to play
128,8UmzC1ZGGE,Colorful game with lots of race combos to keep things interesting. Simple enough gameplay that it can be quite relaxing to play. Friend owns.
91,yqR4PtpO8X,A favortie in our group. Great mix of Euro and conflicting area control mechanisms. Love the threat of combat and the consequences of battles. 
116,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Better than Vinci. Shorter, more thematic, prettier, streamlined, and with fewer unbalanced combos."
129,8UmzC1ZGGE,"great game, 'nuff said"
151,8UmzC1ZGGE,"I like this, but now I only want to play it with people that already know the rules."
140,8UmzC1ZGGE,"This game gets a lot of attention in the webz and because it also looked great I went and got it.
Unfortunately the first game I played of this was way boring. So thought my 2 opponents.
The second time I played it with 3 opponents and while it was a little more interesting this probably only was because I was winning. 2 of the 3 opponents thought it was boring, the other one thought it was ok.
I would'nt recommend to get this game, though it probably just isn't my taste of game."
111,8UmzC1ZGGE,"One of my wife's favorite games, I like the risk feel without the death spiral and with a much more interesting theme in my tastes anyway."
105,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Love the variable powers and how they change game to game. Light area control, with special rules and exceptions driven by your race combination. You also have the chance to change your race as their power wanes or a better combo is affordable.Hit with the boys."
104,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Love the variable powers and how they change game to game. Light area control, with special rules and exceptions driven by your race combination. You also have the chance to change your race as their power wanes or a better combo is affordable.Hit with the boys."
155,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Area control through numerical superiority, plus variable player powers in hundreds of combinations. What I wanted from Cosmic Encounter the first time I played it. Best with more than two players.

Every race/power expansion just makes the game better.

Plays include all race/power expansions owned at the time of the play."
112,8UmzC1ZGGE,To me it is like Risk without the random dice rolling. Always have fun playing Small World and teaching others how to play.
122,8UmzC1ZGGE,"Two games where everyone was new (apart from me in the second of course) and I'd probably need to play more to work out which race/ability combos work well. But, it doesn't seem that interesting, and is very susceptible to slow players making things unpleasant."
79,yqR4PtpO8X,"Very nice art.  Innovative rolling action system where turns are brief and sort of bleed together as one player finishes their bottom action while the turn passes.  Conflict is simple and tangential, the real game is the euro engine building and action selection.  Stegmaier does strong work.
Wife won our first game.  She also really liked it.  So I won too :)

Rise of Fenris is fantastic."
29,yqR4PtpO8X,"1-5 players, asymmetrical 4x euro game, heavy weight, 120 minutes.Rating based on 3 solo games and 3 plays with 3 and 4 players. I can perfectly understand the hype, which was primarily based on art work and theme, and as far as I;m concerned the game delivers on its promise. The different factions all have their own unique abilities which make for a different game each play, also combined with the random player board, which calls for a different strategy each play.People looking for a heavy combat game will be dissapointed, as combat is minimal in the game, however the threat of combat is constant, which, in my view, works very well.I've tried a few games against the AI on easy (Autometta) and normal (Automata) level and that's also a nice experience, which allows you experiment a bit with the combinations and strategies. COnsidering to acquire additional Automa packs in orde to play against mutiple AI's. Also might consider buying the expansion, which adds two new factions to the game."
