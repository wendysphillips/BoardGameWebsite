      "I have almost everything Scythe related. I fell in love with this game shortly after it was commercially released and my love for it has not waned years later. It's a perfect mesh of complexity with iconography that once understood (which is easy to do) feels simple! The different factions work your brain in every which way - and you over time you will realize that there is a group of people that believes every single faction is overpowered....which to me means that they are pretty balanced (well...as balanced as asymmetric factions CAN be).\n",

      "Scythe was a game I was unsure if I'd be interested in. I'd heard amazing things about it, and thought it seemed interesting enough. Luckily it was purchased for me as a gift, and since then this game has been a huge hit. I was afraid the game wouldn't hit the table much at all but it continuously receives play anywhere from 2 to 3/4 players fairly frequently and a few 5+ player games. Everyone loves the game and we've reached an efficiency level so that 2-3 player games only last 40-45 minutes. While there are plenty of folks who have a number of qualms with the game, most of which I've heard and totally understand, this whole experience just clicks right for me and my group and we absolutely adore it.\n",

      "Don't be fooled, this isn't a war game with a lot of strategy and combat between mechs. This is a euro game; worker placement, area controller, and resource management all the way. Overall it's an engine optimization puzzle, with other players as potential obstacles or threats to you reaching your max efficiency.\n",
      "This is a hit with the kids, thus it's a hit with me. I like the fact that it's a light and fun \"wargame\" with some fantasy/comedic elements. All in all, a great way to spend an hour with people you care about. :)\n",

      "Edit 1/16/18: Bumped from 9.4 to 9.7 I was initially skeptical of all the hype surrounding this game, but it has honestly exceeded the hype for me after 22 plays. Attacking with the mechs may be more sparse than initially expected, but the tension created by the threat of attack is just as effective for area control and board manipulation. Wind gambit adds significantly to this tension. Love love love this game.\n",
      "Takes the men on maps mechanic and makes it very fun and more tactical than something like Risk, but still light and fast moving. I love all the races and the way that powers each one has will change every game.\n",
      "I mainly play this solo, and it's a really challenging system.  Really good game mechanics, engine building is so fun, the art is amazing, just an overall really good game.  I imagine the expansions would really shine with a regular gaming group, but find that they don't really work well for solo players.\n",
      "Had a blast each time playing this. Plenty of paths to victory and the different combinations of boards give this a lot of replayability.  The only negative in my mind is the encounter cards all feel the same.\n",
      "1-5\n",
      "But not this one. I've played twice. It's my least desired of all the ones I've played. My buddy backed the KS and made sure to get everything deluxed. Beautiful components, but like many of Jamey's designs, it appears he's taken his favorite bits of previous games and stuck them in whatever current one he's designed. I think it worked for Viticulture and Euphoria. I just couldn't get into this one. I'm still figuring out all the hype that was generated on the box cover art alone...\n",
      "Art and theme is awesome.  Easy game to learn and plays fairly quickly.  The race/trait combos expands the replay value for a long time.Only downside is the box insert.  No clear way to pack everything nice and neat back into the box.  The armies tray does not hold everything evenly and the instruction book diagram for the insert in the back is garbage.\n",

      "2-6 players, 60 minutes, light medium, area control/war gameHave played with 2, 3 and 4 players and all work quite well. The game has different boards for the various number of players, so it will always be a world too small for everyone, which ensures there's plenty of action  The game looks great and the numerous combinations of races and special powers (which are different every game) ensure that replayability is high.\n",
      "First of all, Tales & Legends is an absolute must. Don't play or buy without it. The gameplay is too straight forward, as most of the strategy comes from selecting races and selecting when to go into 'Decline', while the rest of the game kind of plays itself out as you observe from the sideline. The two player game is very weak(unless played with 2 races each), and with five players downtime dominates. Better suited for the youngsters (or as the app).\n",

      "This is a solid area control / euro game, disguised as a war game. While the art and miniatures are top notch, I found the gameplay to be a bit... slow and plodding? I would definitely play it again, but I don't think that I would buy it for my collection.\n",
      "Great game for any size group 2-5 and solid and challenging solo experience once you can learn the movement rules for the Automa\n",
      "My first venture into the hobby and boy, am I glad I did. A close friend didn't like the simple, repetitive dice rolling of Risk and wanted something new. Picked this up on an Amazon sale and haven't looked back. It's fantasy theme was an instant hit and it's replay value is super high.\n",

This game is about building an engine and managing resources. You need to try your best to figure out which 6 stars you will be going for and then go. It might very well be that combat and area control will be a path to your victory or it might be setting up an engine of pumping out tons of resources and avoiding all combat as much as possible.\n",

      "\n",
      "This means three things.  First, since there are no real decisions to make, combat is dull.  Second, there is a big gang-up-on-whoever-is-winning factor, since there's no real way to deter attacks against your opponents aside from creating a wall of guys at your frontiers, Risk-style (and, again Risk-style, an opponent can break through and gobble up your delicious unprotected interior).  Third, since there is also a significant difference in the power levels of the various races and race qualities, there's a big luck factor involved, with the player who happens to be ready to decline when Ghouls or Sorcerers are in the mix in much better shape than the guy who is seeing Dwarves and Wizards (who are boring as well as awful!)\n",

However, from a gameplay perspective some of aspects fall a bit short. For instance, the early game is incredibly limiting, and players fall into scripted openings. And though I enjoy the star-based end game trigger, it appears that a few are more or less mandatory. Completing secret objectives, and winning a battle, are much easier to accomplish than maxing out the power or popularity tracks.

So if you are ahead and only have one star to place you can end the game immediately, but if you are behind in money you can drag the game out by not placing your last star (unless someone else places all their stars of course).\n",
      "The fact that you don't get resources you produced into your supply, but they are placed on the hex they are produced on, is also very interesting, because you can steal resources from others if they don't watch out.\n",
      "I also like that the encounter cards have no text on them (aside from your options), but only a picture of the scene, so you have to interpret it in your own way.\n",
      "I weight it 3/5.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategy:\n",
      "Scythe is a strategy game, so of course their is a lot of strategy involved. Your strategy should depend on your faction, player mat, and starting position. There are 10 ways to plays stars, but you only need to place 6 to end the game, so focus on 6 of those ways. E.g. if you draw shitty objectives, ignore them.\n",
      "Oh, and get your popularity up to at least 13, you need it for the scoring!\n",
      "\n",
      "Luck:\n",
      "Aside from your starting setup (faction and player mat) and the cards you draw (encounters, objectives, factory cards) there is no luck involved. Even combat is not luck, but using power and power cards (and knowing how much power your enemy will spend.\n",
      "\n",
      "Scythe takes about 80-150 minutes to play, depending on player count and how familiar players are with the game. Teaching the rules takes about 20 minutes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary I like Scythe very much and it is the best looking game I own at the moment. We will see if its rating stays that high after a few more plays.\n",
      "Awesome. Has lots of replayability\n",
      "Scythe is great for veteran board game players, but can be too much for more inexperienced players. The game is well designed, but oftentimes is too long. At least one player will realize they have no chance of winning, and will then complain the rest of the game. \n",
      "\n",
      "Also, get boxes for all the meeples.\n",
      "It's a decent-ish game, but I'm not really a fan.\n",
      "I love this game for 2 players. However, my one 4-player experience had way too much down time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update: Lowering my score because it just works so much better as an app. It has made me realize that, as a board game, it's a little slow and clunky.\n",
      "The theme turns me off and I prefer Vinci.\n",
      "This game just doesn't click with me. It's a decent game. It has some unique mechanics. It's interesting enough that I'd play it more but it mostly just feels... unsatisfying.\n",
      "Simple rules but a lot of replayability, especially with the expansions.\n",
      "Scythe is a very rare combination of strong, unique theme with strong, unique mechanisms. Every game is an engaging, unique puzzle.\n",
      "\n",
      "It can best be summed up as an incredibly satisfying experience- the excellent components, world building, game pace and brain-burning decisions have never left me feeling disappointed with a game.\n",
      "July 2016. My first real Kickstarter! I was concerned that it wouldn't live up to the hype, but I'm happy to report that it met and exceeded my expectations. This is one of my favorite games right now. I look forward to playing it many more times over the years. July 2016Returned rating to a 10. I've played 6 solo games, which is pushing it back up for me. I don't usually care about solo gaming that much, but with my limited time lately, it's nice to be able to knock out a game in the evening in about 90 minutes including setup and breakdown. August, 2016.I'm still in love with this game. I haven't been able to play for over a month, but still have TWENTY NINE plays so far this year (that's just from late July through late October!). Solo mode has been great. I've also been solo-testing a campaign I've designed, playing 4-player games by myself. I've gotten a ton of use out of this, and I truly regret not going all-in on the Kickstarter. I've ordered the metal coins, and maybe someday I'll get the realistic resources. I love this game so much. December 4, 2016\n",
      "Early rating is tentative but very promising. It is indeed much less about combat than economy management, which is as the game describes. Whether this serves to mitigate or mask the problems often inherent in multi-player conflict games is yet to be seen.\n",
      "I love that this is a very well thought out strategy game and yet it's easy to learn the rules. I also like the fact that it isn't focused on combat, although you will need to combat other players every now and then. Excellent game, highly recommend it. Even more fun with 5 players.\n",
      "There is so much to this game. It's compelling to both play and to look at. So many ways to play and subtle changes based on your faction and player board that even a veteran player has to stay on their toes.\n",
      "i realy wanted to like this game.. but i hate the downtime between turns.. it realy spoils it for me.  some games have a bearable downtime as they are quite heavy and that's part of the deal.. but this is too light for the down time it has.\n",
      "My wife likes it which means, I like it.\n",
      "I haven't gotten to play with more than 2, but solo and 2 player is fantastic and it's supposed to be even better with 4/5\n",
      "If you're not a fan of area control war themed games, chances are your exposure is mostly Risk or Axis and Allies. Smallworld takes the region conquering motif to a more strategic level. There are no dice - well, ok there is one die to act as support if you don't have enough tokens left over for your last invasion. Otherwise it's simply invade and defend. Each race gets paired randomly with a power. And since the combinations change with every game, the possibilities are endless. When your race expands too thin, just go into decline and start a new one. The game plays fast and competitive. It's even more fun if you play on a board meant for one player fewer (ie, play 5 people on the 4 player board, etc.).\n",

      "\n",

      "Very nice art.  Innovative rolling action system where turns are brief and sort of bleed together as one player finishes their bottom action while the turn passes.

I can perfectly understand the hype, which was primarily based on art work and theme, and as far as I;m concerned the game delivers on its promise. The different factions all have their own unique abilities which make for a different game each play, also combined with the random player board, which calls for a different strategy each play.People looking for a heavy combat game will be dissapointed, as combat is minimal in the game, however the threat of combat is constant, which, in my view, works very well.I've tried a few games against the AI on easy (Autometta) and normal (Automata) level and that's also a nice experience, which allows you experiment a bit with the combinations and strategies. COnsidering to acquire additional Automa packs in orde to play against mutiple AI's. Also might consider buying the expansion, which adds two new factions to the game.\n"

Luckily it was purchased for me as a gift, and since then this game has been a huge hit. I was afraid the game wouldn't hit the table much at all but it continuously receives play anywhere from 2 to 3/4 players fairly frequently and a few 5+ player games. Everyone loves the game and we've reached an efficiency level so that 2-3 player games only last 40-45 minutes. While there are plenty of folks who have a number of qualms with the game, most of which I've heard and totally understand, this whole experience just clicks right for me and my group and we absolutely adore it\"\n",
